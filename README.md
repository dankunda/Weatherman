# whats-the-weather

A tool to get the weather forecast for your city for the next 4 days (day and night), using user's input from the command line–outputting the results to a .csv file that you can open, view, and edit.

Utilizes these libraries/modules: Beautiful Soup, Requests, Selenium, Pandas, and geonamescache (which obtains its data from GeoNames).

Works with all US major cities, as well as most other lesser-known towns/cities.
